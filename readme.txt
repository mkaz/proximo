## Credits

Theme initially generated from https://components.underscores.me/ by forking
this repo https://github.com/Automattic/theme-components

Components has a few too many files and little pieces everywhere, I combined a
bunch to make it easier to find what to update.


Proximo theme was loosely modeled after the design of Next.js blog, at least
the same white background.
